The following is a list of files in the raw/objects/ folder necessary for Dwarf Fortress version 43.05; removing them causes unpredictable behavior, mostly crashing, in different parts of the game because they provide definitions for tokens hard-coded into the executable:
*b_detail_plan.txt - provides required body detail plan tokens for the object testing arena and world generation
*body_default.txt - provides the body part tokens used to define creaturs
*body_rcp.txt - provides the body part tokens used to randomly generate creatures
*c_variation_default.txt - provides creature variation tokens required by the object testing arena and world generation
*creature_standard.txt - defines dwarfs and standard creatures.
*descriptor_color_standard.txt - provides color definitions required by the object testing arena and world generation
*descriptor_pattern_iris_eye.txt - provides descriptions for creature irises
*descriptor_pattern_pupil_eye.txt - provides descriptions for creature pupils.
*descriptor_shape_standard.txt - provides descriptions for shapes required by the testing arena and world generation.
*entity_default.txt - defines various civilizations
*inorganic_metal.txt - Allows dwarfs to dig and defines various metals for the dwarfs to dig.
*inorganic_stone_layer.txt - Required for world generation
*interaction_standard.txt - Defines interactions required for world generation.
*item_ammo.txt - defines ammo used by dwarfs
*item_armor.txt - defines armor used by dwarfs
*item_gloves.txt - defines gloves used by dwarfs
*item_helm.txt - defines helmets used by dwarfs
*item_pants.txt - defines pants used by dwarfs
*item_shield.txt - defines shield items used by dwarfs
*item_shoes.txt - defines shoes used by dwarfs
*item_seigeammo.txt - defines seige ammo used by dwarfs
*item_tool.txt - defines tools used by dwarfs
*item_toy.txt - defines toys used by dwarfs
*item_trapcomp.txt - defines trap components used by dwarfs.
*item_weapon.txt - defines weapons used by dwarfs
*language_DWARF.txt - defines the dwarf language
*language_SYM.txt - defines the grammar of different words
*language_words.txt - defnes words used by the system
*material_template_default.txt - defines materials required by object testing and dwarfs
*plant_standard.txt - defines standard plants required for dwarfs
*tissue_template_default.txt - defines tissue tokens used to define body parts.

Additionally, the following files in the raw/objects/text/ folder are required to play Dwarf Fortress because the relative file paths are hard-coded into the executable.
*secret_death.txt
*book_instruction.txt
*book_art.txt

Note that these files are required, but their contents seem meaningless; the game will crash if they are not found or if they are empty.

inorganic_stone_layer.txt is required for Fortress mode.
The ability to dig is provided by inorganic_metal. I don't know why.
