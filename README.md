# Dwarf-Fortress-Minimalist-RAW
This repository contain the minimum RAW files for Dwarf Fortress to run, all taken from Dwarf Fortress Vanilla.

The files in the raw folder can replace your main raw folder, but not a save-specific raw folder. If you delete any of the files from Dwarf Fortress Vanilla with similar names, the game will not work, either because it will crash, or because your dwarfs' abilities will be limitied.

Please feel free to branch this repository, add documentation, corrections, etc. and send a pull request.
